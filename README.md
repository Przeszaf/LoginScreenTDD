# LoginScreenTDD

Hey, this is my first take on TDD. All things in the app are my first try on unit, integration and UI testing. I know that there are some things that are probably not perfect, such as naming or too many/few tests for certain functions. 

Usually I use branching while using git, but for this project I think it would be an overkill. Also, at the beginning I was commiting after each passed test, but afterwards I started commiting new features with tests included, as the repo would have a lot of commits otherwise.

I designed it like I would design a part of a bigger app - by using managers that are used to do one specific task (i.e. AlertManager - used for creating alerts, URLManager - for URLs).

All in all, I think that it was great experience and by using TDD I've found issues with some functions, that would be very hard to spot otherwise and I'll definietly use this process it in my future apps.
